## Problem Statement

Large-scale sales operations often suffer from data inconsistencies, anomalies, and outliers due to operational mishaps, human errors, or fraudulent activities. Traditional data validation methods struggle to identify these hidden discrepancies, leading to incorrect financial reporting, compliance risks, and operational inefficiencies. 

AURALYTIX addresses this challenge by developing an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that audits structured sales datasets, intelligently flags anomalies, and predicts their severity.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Layered Anomaly Detection**: Combines rule-based, statistical, and AI-driven techniques
- **RAG-Based Auditing**: Leverages state-of-the-art language models to analyze sales data patterns
- **Severity Scoring Model**: Prioritizes flagged issues based on business impact
- **Adaptive Learning with MLOps**: Self-improving model that continuously refines detection based on feedback
- **Detailed Audit Reports**: Generates comprehensive reports with detected anomalies, risk levels, and corrective actions
- **Interactive Dashboards**: React-based visual insights to help stakeholders understand issues
- **API Integration**: RESTful API built with Express.js for seamless integration with existing systems

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Material UI, Chart.js, D3.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **ML/AI**: Python, LangChain, HuggingFace Transformers, scikit-learn
- **RAG Implementation**: LangChain, FAISS/Chroma vector stores, OpenAI embeddings
